# LJS (Literally Just Survival) Plugin
#### by SweptThrone (sweptthr.one)
#### - Version 2 -

LJS is a simple plugin for Minecraft Spigot servers
designed to allow your players to to teleport back
and forth to a plain survival server with ease.

Upon initial startup, your server will generate a
new blank world called LJSurvival.  To access this
world, type /ljs join in-game.  You will be
teleported to this new world, and able to play. If
you type /ljs leave, you will leave the world and
return to where you were before, with everything
you had before.

If you leave the game while in LJS, you will join
back in LJS "mode."

Though I've tried to prevent some teleporting into
and out of world issues, I am very inexperienced
with actual Java programming and the Spigot API.

This plugin is provided free of charge for anyone
to use and modify, just don't charge for it if
you decide to make changes.  
I'm too lazy to figure out licensing and stuff.

This code is really messy and bad, it's the first
thing in Java I've done from scratch, and I'm very
inexperienced with the language.  Any criticism
will be taken, but constructive criticism will be
appreciated and considered.
